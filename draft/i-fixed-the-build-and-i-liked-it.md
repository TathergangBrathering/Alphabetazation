I'm just a regular PO, your average project leader
The build was red, waited for green - triggered my fixing fever
It's not what I'm used to do, just wanna go and try it out
It's a curious thing to do stuck in my imagination

I fixed a bug and I liked it
Debugging mystery to solve
I fixed a build and I liked it
I hope my dev won't mind it

The bug was wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm a hero tonight
I fixed a build and I liked it, I liked it

They were confused the build is green
They wondered who could it have been
I feel like a super hero with a secret identity
I code at night to keep up the fight
Against all your committed crimes

#TODO: write second verse
#Der Build ist grün, aber keiner weiß warum
#Niemand weiß Bescheid außer der stille Held und er fühlt sich geil
#suchen absurde Begründungen: Mondphase, Venus, Schaltjahr, Krümmung des Raumzeitkontinuums, 42,

The build was red, waited for green, it took for-ever-ever-ever
I got so brave, the bug in sight, I got my fixing fever
It's not what I'm used to do, just wanna go and try it out
It's a curious thing to do stuck in my imagination

I fixed a bug and I liked it
Debugging mystery to solve
I fixed a build and I liked it
I hope my dev-ops won't mind it

The bug was so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm dev-ops - just for tonight
I fixed a bug and I liked it, I liked it


This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you, caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey


I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it

Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it
