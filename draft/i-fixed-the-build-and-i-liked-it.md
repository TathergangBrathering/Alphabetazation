I'm just a regular PO, your average project leader
The build was red, waited for green - triggered my fixing fever
It's not what I'm used to do, just wanna go and try it out
It's a curious thing to do stuck in my imagination

  I fixed a bug and I liked it    (Matze)
  Debugging mystery to solve      (Swen)
  I fixed a build and I liked it  (Matze)
  I hope my dev won't mind it     (Swen)

  The bug was wrong, it felt so right (Matze / Swen)
  Don't mean I'm a hero tonight       (Matze)
  I fixed a build and I liked it, I liked it (Swen)

They were confused the build is green
They wondered who could it have been
They were confused the build is green // TODO FIXME
They wondered who could it have been
I feel like a super hero with a secret identity
I code at night to keep up the fight
Against all your committed crimes

  I fixed a bug and I liked it
  Debugging mystery to solve
  I fixed a build and I liked it
  I hope my dev won't mind it

  The bug was wrong, it felt so right
  Don't mean I'm a hero tonight
  I fixed a build and I liked it, I liked it

To develop software is dramatical
Short stop for comical relief
Then the return to tragedy
Tales from the hub
Version two point three
Our anti pattern can continue to be

  I fixed a bug and I liked it
  Debugging mystery to solve
  I fixed a build and I liked it
  I hope my dev won't mind it 
  
  Refrain wiederholen

  The bug was wrong, it felt so right
  To squash it really tight
  I fixed a build and I liked it, I liked it

The build was red, waited for green, it took for-ever-ever-ever
I got so brave, the bug in sight, I got my fixing fever
It's not what I'm used to do, just wanna go and try it out
It's a curious thing to do stuck in my imagination

I fixed a bug and I liked it
Debugging mystery to solve
I fixed a build and I liked it
I hope my dev-ops won't mind it

The bug was so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm dev-ops - just for tonight
I fixed a bug and I liked it, I liked it
