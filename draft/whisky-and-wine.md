Capo 2nd

Whisky & Wine

	Start with the whisky and end with the wine
	Stop when your world seems to be fine
	Hang on the good times and one pint beer
	

Come and tell me stories, show me your life on a plate
No need to hurry, it still ain't that late
Did you really run and hide?
Try to escape your darkest nights
When all lights used to hide
And only shadows seem to shine so bright
When night mares grow unaware and your hope had disappeared

	Start with the whiskey and end with the wine
	Stop when your world seems to be fine
	Hang on the good times and one pint beer
	Take your time, your beer and cheers

All stories have been told, there's nothing left to say
Conversations getting cold, everybodys back out on their way
//Don't stop and stay, please go away
You'd like to whistle the melodies
Linked to your past million memories
Et ce qu'il pleut tu cris plus
J'ai perdu paradis...

	Start with the whiskey and end with the wine
	Stop when your world seems to be fine
	Hang on the good times and one pint beer
	Time doesn't wait even when you're here
	
	Awaiting execution, thinking how to survive
	Everyone's guilty but you're still alive
	Forget your past, your life must go on
	Life's a chance, don't hesitate 'til it's gone

Think for a moment about the years that have passed
Now ain't forever and nothing safe will last
You cry, you beg, you lie, you crack, you die before you feel alive
All the people you let down, left with their love all alone

	Start with the whiskey and end with the wine
	Stop when your world seems to be fine
	Hang on the good times and one pint beer
	Time doesn't wait even when you're here
	
	Awaiting execution, thinking how to survive
	Everyone's guilty but you're still alive
	Forget your past, your life must go on
	Life's a chance, don't hesitate 'til it's gone
