Hi from AHOI

Hi I am Swen developer with AHOI
Where I engineer, take care and deploy
Features for our multibanking A-P-I
Which I encourage you to try

Let's start our tour about tales from the hub 
This is our Sandbox Manager where your registration 
where you should start
And learn about us and AHOI and take a heart
To get your first contact
Use your own Sandbank credentials
To unlock AHOI's full potential

Let's look into the past with your transactions summarized
Or watch your month's forecast to have surprised
By the amount of month at the end of your money
(Cause it's all about the money-money-money)

Find all the recurring transactions ruining your budget
And thanks to finlytics even identify your contracts

To make things easier for you
We'Ve got some tools you can use
Prebuilt SDKs you can include in your code
Or our AHOI demo app I will show now
Use it as a launch pad to get your hot shit flying
It's not rocket science and has a nice U-I

If you've got questions please raise your hands now
Or visit us in our kitchen after the show
Thanks for your time - we hope you enjoy
Your hackathon with us - best wishes from AHOI

-----------------------------------------

Welcome to our short song about AHOI
To show you how we care, develop and deploy
It's part of our epic tour tales from the hub
Be sure to be there for our next stop
