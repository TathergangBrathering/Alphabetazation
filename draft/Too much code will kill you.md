```
I see just pieces of the code I need to read
Too many littered lines are bloating on my screen
No structure left to see
Copy wasteland code to me
Line four thousand nine

I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
Software development and what a struggle it would be
Reading someone elses lines
He had no clue in his mind
Of what's going on

  Too much code will kill you
  If you can't make sense at all
  Torn between rewriting and scrapping it at all
  You're headed for disaster
  'Cause you never read the lines
  Too much code will kill you - everytime

Still in the same function that I used to call
No return if else or submethod at all
I'm used to my own style
But who wrote this back a while
Had no clue at all

Oh how would it be if the author took my example
Names like documentary in a short compre-hensive style
I'm tooting my own horn
Wish I could do it all on my own...

  Too much code will kill you
  If you can't make sense at all
  Torn between rewriting and ignoring it at all
  I'm headed for disaster
  'Cause I never read the lines
  Too much code will kill you - every time

Now I'm running git blame for me to see
The lunatic committing this attrocity
I can't trust my own eyes
But the commit never lies
It was meeeeeee

  Too much code will kill you
  If you don't rewrite at all
  Refactoring and reading the Clean Code manual
  Once copy paste disaster 
  of spaghetti code my friend
  Too much code will kill you - in the end

-----------------------------------------------

Copy waste land
Copy paste
Spaghetti code
Lines of code
Screen size
Redundancy
