  Unit tests, unit tests
  Unit test all day
  Oh what fun it is to write
  A unit test today

Exception in a call
In REST service you know
Delivering 500 codes
To the customer seems false

Hand-ling this right
Catching it in time
Oh what fun it is to right and write
A unit test today

  Unit tests, unit tests
  Unit test all day
  Oh what fun it is to write
  A unit test today

The test case is a mess
Who would have ever guessed
That test code should be readable
And also be maintained

You're swearing and you know
If the author will ever show
Up again with a question
At your desk then you will throw

Hard words in his face
He better should embrace
And learn how to wri-hite a test
For your next best psycho path!

  Unit tests, unit tests
  Unit test all day
  Oh what fun it is to write
  A unit test today

Debbuging, stepping into, functions, methods

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse sleigh, hey.

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh.

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making sprits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.


Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh. Hey!

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh.

You know I hate the cold
That's why I always go
Down south to drink some rum
On a island in the sun.

There's nothing like St. Croix
With the palm trees swaying slow
Or being there on an open dock
When the New Year comes and goes.

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey.

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh...
