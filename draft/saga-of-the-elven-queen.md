Tales from the hub

The saga of the elven queen 
Begins where you would not have seen
A girl of higher power
To spend her waking hour
She's assistant to the lord of the board
Fighting in his name 
Battles glistening with fame
Against menacing hordes
Of stakeholders and paper chores


The elven queen to save the nerds
To organize and rule their worlds
To take the calls and open doors
And shield them from the stakeholders


If the coffee machine is broken once again
She's relentless on the phone with the technician
Until it brews again she knows no pardon
She reigns wise from her rolling throne


The elven queen to save the nerds
To organize and rule their worlds
To take the calls and open doors
And shield them from the stakeholders
