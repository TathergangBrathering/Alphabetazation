[C G D7 Em]
Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas day
[C G D7 G]
Drivin' the cattle on the snow-covered plains.
[C G D7 Em]
All of the good gifts given today;
[C G D7 G]
Ours is the sky and the wide open range. 

[C G D7 Em]

[C G D7 Em]
Back in the cities, they have different ways,
[C G D7 G]
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades. 
[C G D7 Em]
I'll take the blanket; I'll take the reins;
[C G D7 G]
Christmas for Cowboys and wide open plains.

[C G D7 Em]
[C G D7 G]
 
[C G D7 Em]
A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night; 
[C G D7 G]
The stars overhead are the Christmas-tree lights. 
[C G D7 Em]
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray;
[C G D7 G]
Christmas for Cowboys and the wide open plains.

[C G D7 Em]
It's tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day, 
[C G D7 G]
Drivin' the cattle on the snow-covered plains. 
[C G D7 Em]
So many gifts have been opened today; 
[C G D7 G]
Ours is the sky and the wide open range. 
[C G D7 Em]
It's Christmas for Cowboys and wide open plains.
[C G D7 G]
It's Christmas for Cowboys and wide open plains.
