[C G Am F | C G F-C-G-C]
When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom:
"Write in C." 

  [Am G F C | C G F-C-G-C]
  Write in C, Write in C,
  Write in C, oh, Write in C.
  LOGO's dead and buried,
  Write in C. 

[C Am F G]
Every bug you make
Every change you break
Every build you take
Every test you fake
I'll be watching

  [F C D G]
  Oh can't you see
  You ruin every PC
  My poor build breaks
  With every change you make

[G Am] 4x
Let's talk about tests, baby
Let's talk about unit-tests and me (sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the failed builds that may be

  [G] 4x
  Let's talk about tests (come on)
  Let's talk about tests (do it)
  Let's talk about tests (uh-huh)
  Let's talk about tests
  
[Am F C G] 3x
I start this lonely job on the boulevard of broken builds
Console logs home to me
I'm lonely dev-ops
I code alone, I code alone
I code alone, I code a-

  [F C G Am | F C G Am | F C G Am | F C E]
  My build slave the only one that messages me
  My shell console the only thing that's blinking with me
  Sometimes I wish someone out there would hack me
  Till then I code alone...
  
  [C G Am C F C D G]
  Where do broken builds go?
  Are they always lost
  Teaching us nothing
  Of the faults that broke them down
  
  [C G Am F | C F C G]
  No code smells no cry
  No code smells no cry
  
[C G Am F]
Said I remember when we used to code
Without patterns or clue
Back when Uncle Bob wrote
The Clean Code manual
Of which he shared with us

[C G Am F]
Grandma Beck said
If it smells then change it
Either diaper or code

  [C G Am F | C F C G]
  No code smells no cry
  No code smells no cry
