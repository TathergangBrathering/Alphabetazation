When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom:
"Write in C." 

  Write in C, Write in C,
  Write in C, oh, Write in C.
  LOGO's dead and buried,
  Write in C. 

Every bug you make
Every change you break
Every build you take
Every test you fake
I'll be watching

  Oh can't you see
  You are my devotee
  My poor build breaks
  With every change you make
  
Let's talk about tests, baby
Let's talk about unit-tests and me (sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the failed builds that may be

  Let's talk about tests (come on)
  Let's talk about tests (do it)
  Let's talk about tests (uh-huh)
  Let's talk about tests

I start this lonely job on the boulevard of broken builds
Console logs home to me
I'm lonely dev-ops
I code alone, I code alone
I code alone, I code a-

  My build slave the only one that messages me
  My shell console the only thing that's blinking
  Sometimes I wish someone out there would hack me
  Till then I code alone...
  
  So can you merge your branch tonight? You've come so far
  It's enough for this tired developer, a lone rock star
  And can you build your branch tonight? To close your pull request
  It's been a long day and a long night, give it a rest save your fight
  
  Where do broken builds go?
  Can they fix their own
  Fix the build break
  Of the committer that made them crash down
  
  No code smells no cry
  No code smells no cry
  
Said I remember when we used to code
Without patterns or clue


Another bug bites the dust

  Are you happy, are you satisfied?
  How long can you stand the heat?
  Out of the doorway the bullets rip
  To the sound of the beat

```
