Capo 4th

[Verse 1]
    Em                             C              B7
God rest you merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
    Em                           C              B7
For Jesus Christ our Saviour was born upon this day
   Am               G                  Em            D
To save us all from Satan's pow'r when we were gone astray
 
[Chorus]
  G          B7          Em               D
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
  G          B7          Em
O tidings of comfort and joy
 
[Verse 2]
     Em                        C             B7
From God our heavenly Father a blessed angel came
    Em                             C              B7
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same
    Am            G                Em            D
How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name
 
[Chorus]
  G          B7          Em               D
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
  G          B7          Em
O tidings of comfort and joy
 
[Verse 3]
    Em                           C              B7
The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind
    Em                             C                  B7
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind
    Am            G                    Em              D
And went to Bethlehem straightway this blessed Babe to find
 
[Chorus]
  G          B7          Em               D
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
  G          B7          Em
O tidings of comfort and joy
 
[Verse 5]
    Em                            C               B7
Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place
    Em                                  C           B7
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace
     Am           G             Em           D
This holy tide of Christmas all other doth deface
 
[Chorus]
  G          B7          Em               D
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
  G          B7          Em
O tidings of comfort and joy
