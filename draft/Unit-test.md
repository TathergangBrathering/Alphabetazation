Unit tests

"What a waste of time"
You think and try
Writing your tests after a feature
You're a habitual creature

You like your coffee black
Talking to your co-workers on slack
Refactoring your code to fit a test
You're a programmer at best

Your tests don't fit
Your actual code a bit
Test coverage below ten percent
For your ten page method at hand

You ponder where you went wrong
Struggling with refactoring getting done
Maybe you should have written tests first?
And now your bubble bursts

What if you would first specify expectations?
Declare public methods to test your relations
Split large block into small functional units
One specific target and then test the bits
```
