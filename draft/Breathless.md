C
We're gonna wander the streets and clubs of this town,
Am                                    G   C
This is our night, made for us, oho, oho, oho.
C
I close my eyes, erase all taboos.
Am                                       G   C
Kisses on the skin, like a love tattoo, oho, oho.

                 F        C                   G   Am
Whatever that is between us, pictures you never forget
                   F     C                     G
And your look showed me this is our time.

  F                 C
  Breathless through the night,
          G         Am
  Until a new day awakens
  F                 C
  Breathlessly just out
          G         Am
  Your eyes take me off!
  F                 C
  Breathless through the night
          G         Am
  Feel what love does to us   
  F                 C  
  Breathless, free from vertigo, 
          G         Am
  great cinema for us two
  F                    C
  We are eternal today, a thousand feelings of happiness
  G                        Am
  All I am, I share with you
  F                    C
  We're inseparable, somehow immortal.
  G                        Am
  Come take my hand and go with me

C
Let's go up to the highest roof in the world.
Am                                           G   C
Just hold on to what's holding us together, oho, oho
C
Are you really addicted, skin to skin all intoxicated,
Am                                          G   C
Fall into my arms and the parachute opens, oho, oho.

                 F        C                   G   Am
Whatever that is between us, pictures you never forget
                   F     C                     G
And your look showed me this is our time.

  F                 C

  Breathlessly just out
          G         Am
  Your eyes take me off!
