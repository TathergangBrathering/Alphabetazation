C
We're gonna wander the streets and clubs of this town,
Am                                          G   C
This is our night, made for the two of us, oho, oho.
C
I close my eyes, erase all taboos.
Am                                       G   C
Kisses on the skin, like a love tattoo, oho, oho.

                 F        C                   G   Am
Whatever this is between us, pictures you'll never forget
                   F     C                     G
And your look showed me this is our time.

  F                 C
  Out of breath through the night,
          G         Am
  Until a new dawn arrives
  F                 C
  Breathlessly just out
          G         Am
  Your eyes undress 'n' eat me out!
  F                 C
  Out of breath through the night
          G         Am
  Feel the love to us applied
  F                 C  
  Out of breath, no vertigo, 
          G         Am
  great cinema for us two
  
  F                    C
  We're eternal in this moment, abundant blissful feelings
  G                        Am
  All I am, I share with you
  F                    C
  Inseparable and probably immortal.
  G                        Am
  Go take my hand and come with me

C
Let's climb up to the highest roof top in the world.
Am                         G   C
Just hold on to our bond, oho, oho
C
You really are addicted, skin to skin inebriated
Am                                 G   C
Fall into my arms and just relax, oho, oho.

                 F        C                   G   Am
All I want is here, great pure freedom, close at hand
                   F     C                     G
No, we don't want to leave where everything's perfection

  F                 C
  Out of breath through the night,
          G         Am
  Until a new dawn arrives
  F                 C
  Breathlessly just out
          G         Am
  Your eyes undress 'n' eat me out!
  F                 C
  Out of breath through the night
          G         Am

  Go take my hand and come with me

  F                 C
  Breathlessly
          G         Am
  Lust resonates on my skin
  F                 C
  Out of breath through the night
          G         Am
  Feel the love to us applied
