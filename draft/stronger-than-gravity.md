Capo 2nd

Picture this mess
Everywhere scatter, scars and regress
Another villain trying to get his hold on this world
And I'm off to save my girl

I'm the bad man, the one without manor
I am enemy number one to everyone, a hero just for you
I am good and evil, shadow and light
All the good things appearing with you at my side

Can you see reality
Trying to force gravity
To work on me
Your love is strong
And the gravity is gone


Save the cheerleader, save the world
Evil has tons of plans to rule and work
While the good seem to lack this potential
It's substantial - to keep on top of the world

Can you see reality
Trying to force gravity
To work on me
Your love is strong
And the mass attraction is gone
You believe in me
And so I can see
Your love defeats gravity
I know I can fly
I just didn't have time to try
