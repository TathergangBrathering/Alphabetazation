I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus chords
Tommy Connor 1952

G                   Bm 
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus,
Em                            D
underneath the mistletoe last night.
    C             D
She didn t see me creep,
         G         D/F#   Em
down the stairs to have a peep
    A
She thought that I was tucked up
      D             
in my bedroom fast asleep.

      G                  Bm    
Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus,
Em                            C    
underneath his beard so snowy white
    C               D
Oh, what a laugh it would have been,
   G         D/F# Em
if Daddy had only seen
C             D                G
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night.


G Bm Em D

underneath the mistletoe last night.
    C             D
She didn t see me creep,
         G         D/F#   Em
