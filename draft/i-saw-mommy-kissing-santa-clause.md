I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus chords
Tommy Connor 1952

C                   Em 
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus,
Am                            G
underneath the mistletoe last night.
    F             G
She didn t see me creep,
         C         G/B    Am
down the stairs to have a peep
    D
She thought that I was tucked up
      G             
in my bedroom fast asleep.

      C                  Em    
Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus,
Am                            F    
underneath his beard so snowy white
    F               G
Oh, what a laugh it would have been,
   C         G/B  Am
if Daddy had only seen
F             G                C
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night.
