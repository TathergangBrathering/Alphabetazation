Can you merge your branch tonight

There's a calm surrender when you create your pull request
When all coding is done and you just wait for tests
A swearsome moment when you repeat again and again

It's enough for the day when all your efforts are in vain
So can you compile your code tonight? You've come so far
It's enough for this tired developer who was greater
And can you merge your branch tonight? Close your ticket
It's enough for the day close your laptop lid and close your eyes

---------------------------------------

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best

There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best
