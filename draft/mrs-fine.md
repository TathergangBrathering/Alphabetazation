Hey Miss Fine
You drive by
And drop a line
When I reply
You just walk on
Waving bye bye bye

Am G F C|C/B
Can't get a hold on you
Don't understand your motivation
My human condition
Your tourette syndrome

Am F C G
  Hey Miss Fine
  Are you alright?
  Hey Miss Fine
  I have no clue what's on your mind

Am G F C|C/B
Then one night at a bar
Not sure how we got this far
You turn my joke on me
I look into your eyes and see love
L-O-V-E

F G C Am|G F G C
Hey Miss Fine
Doesn't your boyfriend mind?
That you're confessing your heart
To me

Am F C G
  Hey Miss Fine
  You're stuck in my mind
  Dear Miss Fine
  Do you have some time?
  You've shown me yours
  I'd like to show you mine

F G C Am|G F G C
You suck on your cigarette
Dragging the moment out
I thought of your tourette
And the time it bought you
To think about
This state of sanity
Your current relationship
Or whatever this is about

Am G F C|C/B
Now that I've worked on my courage
You shutdown my efforts
No time for a break
No time for coffee with me

Am G F C|C/B
I get my anger and rage
Wish that I had never known
That night at the bar
What you have shown me

Am F C G
  Fuck you Miss Fine
  Fuck you Miss Fine
  Nice that you made up your mind
  But fuck you Miss Fine
  I like you but I don't like your style

F G C Am|G F G C
My last try is this song
In the hopes that you got me wrong
Or am I just too late
To ask you out on a date?

Am F C G
  Hey Miss Fine
  You're stuck in my mind
  Dear Miss Fine
  Do you have some time?
  Hey ~~~~~
  Do you wanna grab a coffee with me
Am F C G
  Hey Miss Fine
  You're stuck in my mind
  Dear Miss Fine
  Do you have some time?
  Hey ~~~~~
  Do you wanna grab a coffee with me
  You've shown me your heart
  Now I'd like to show you mine
```
